BioTekLiquidHandler
===================

VWorks plugin for controlling BioTek liquid handlers

Currently a work in progress.

Compared to Agilent's plugin...
* No XML RPC servers to run
* Support for MultiFloFX instruments
* No association of an LHC protocol folder with device profile (easier for our protocol file organization method)
